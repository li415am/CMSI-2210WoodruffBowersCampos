SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

If you got a warning about using "gets()" when you compiled your
   "sayhelloplus.c" program, try using a different function.  Look up
   the "C" functions on the Internet and see if you can find something
   else to use, like "scanf()" or "fgets()" or something else.

As a challenge to yourselves, see if you can find a different way of reading
   values from the user.  There are several different ways of doing that, so
   do a little research to see what else is available.

Remember that assembly code is very column-oriented.  Try to line everything
   up in the same columns, even the line-by-line comments.

Off to a great start!
