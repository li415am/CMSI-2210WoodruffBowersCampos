Part 1: The program runs for all the various outputs given (dogs, $123.45, empty line) as well as various other test inputs. However, if the input entered is too long then a message saying "*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated Aborted (core dumped)" is displayed. Also, the compiler gives a warning when compiling sayhello.c, stating that the get function is dangerous and should not be used. It still compiles into the executable.

Part 2: This program very simply prints out Hello, World using assembly. I am running Linux so the starter code had to be changed subtly. A website that helped with installing nasm, running the program, and learning a bit about assembly was Ray Toal's website: https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/.
