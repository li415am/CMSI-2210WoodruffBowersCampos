9.  Part 1: The data in r8 and r9 have been switched, in other words the value that was
    in r8 is now in r9 and the value in r9 is now in r8.

    Part 2: This effect happens because when we exlusive or r8 and r9 the value is the
    difference between the two. Then when we XOR r9 and r8, r9 now becomes the value of r8,
    because the difference between the two is added. Then when we xor r8 and r9 the value
    in r8 becomes the original value of r8, which is r9 minus the difference.
